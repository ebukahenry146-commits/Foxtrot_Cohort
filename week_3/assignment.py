# 1. Use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 15.
# Answer no 1 here.

#n = 1
#while n < 16:
 #print(n)
 #n += 1

# 2. Use a while loop to print only the even numbers between 1 and 20.
# Answer no 2 here.

i = 1
while i<=20:
    if i%2==0:
       print (i)
    i=i+1

# 3. Given a list of names = ["Anna", "Bola", "Chris", "Dayo"],
#    use a for loop to print each name in the list.
# Answer no 3 here.

names =["Anna", "Bola", "Chris", "Dayo"],
for name in names:
     print(name)

# 4. From the list numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
#    use a for loop to multiply each number by 3
#    and add the results into a new list. Print the new list.
# Answer no 4 here.


# 5. Use a for loop to check if "Chris" is in the list of names = ["Anna", "Bola", "Chris", "Dayo"].

# Answer no 8 here.


# 9. Given two lists:
#    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
#    list2 = [4, 5, 6]
#    Use a for loop to add all the numbers in list2 into list1.
#    Print the final list1.
# Answer no 9 here.
